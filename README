README for Social Media Requirements Gathering

Zach Fry(frydawgt524@gmail.com) - 5/23/2013

/old_work/ directory is old work that I did earlier on in the Semester
    /old_work/topics/mallet has mallet scripts that model both NEMO and Boston Tweets
    /old_work/twitter_crawler has the python code that wraps the twitter API
    
/static_demo/ is all the HTML and JavaScript code for the Dashboard Static Demo
    /static_demo/input is where the datafiles for the dashboard live

/dashboard_data/ is where all the magic happens for the current version of things as of 5/23
    /dashboard_data/generateDashboardData.py is python script that gets Tweets from the RDF Store 
        and converts it into the necessary output for the dashboard
        should be able to get everything from the comments
        to run:
            python generateDashboardData.py

    /dashboard_data/output is where all of the output that gets plugged into the dashboard goes
        these files will go to /static_demo/input to get plugged into the dashboard

    /dashboard_data/mallet is where all of the mallet topic modelling happens
